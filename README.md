- 👋 Hi, I’m @sjas666
- 👀 I’m interested in electronic music, dubstep music and electro-house, also I want to learn more about programming and computer science, and I'm currently in my way to find myself, my 
      personal pat.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++ and C, specially the second one, and I want to learn more but I'm very lazy :((
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... With no one right now, I'm not very good at this and I don't wanna be a stubborn to anyone.
